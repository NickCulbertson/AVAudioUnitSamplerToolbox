# AVAudioUnitSampler Toolbox

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCulbertson/AVAudioUnitSamplerToolbox/master/screenshot.png)

This is an example implementation of using AVAudioUnitSampler with AVAudioEngine and Apple's built-in effects. The Controls and Keyboard are from [AudioKit](https://github.com/AudioKit) and the MIDI comes from [MIDIKit](https://github.com/orchetect/MIDIKit). It doesn't use any third party libraries for the audio engine. Work in Progress. :D
